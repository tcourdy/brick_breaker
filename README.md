# brick_breaker

Brick breaker game to begin learning plain old javascript.  

Followed the tutorial here:  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript

Began adding additional features to the game such as a leveling system and power ups.

Plan to continue to add more functionality as school/work permits in order to learn more javascript.
